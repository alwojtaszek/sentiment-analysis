**Sentiment Analysis**

This repository is dedicated to exploring various sentiment analysis techniques,
from traditional machine learning models to advanced neural network architectures.
The project aims to compare these methods' effectiveness in classifying text data by sentiment,
utilizing diverse feature extraction techniques such as Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and others.

**Overview**

The sentiment analysis project is exploration of different sentiment analysis techniques. It uses
- Kaggle Dataset URL: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mdfahimreshm/bert-finetuning-with-explainability-for-beginners/input
  Download and unzip into a 'data' directory within the script's folder.
- Modify 'url' in hybrid_word2vec_tfidf_data_prep.get_data() if the data is stored in a different location.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.6 or later.
Pip package manager.
